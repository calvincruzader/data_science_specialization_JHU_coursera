Types of Data Science Questions 
approximate order of difficulty:
	descriptive 
		first kind of data analysis performed 
		descriptions cannot be generalized usually without additional statistical modeling 
		example: US Census, google Ngram 
	exploratory 
		goal: find relationships you didn't know about 
		models are good for discovering new connections 
		useful for defining future studies 
		exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting 
		example: brain scans that light up in response to a stimulus
	inferential
		goal: use a small amount of sample data to say something about a bigger population 
		commmonly the goal of statistical models 
		involves estimating both the quantity you care about and the uncertainty about your estimate 
		inference depends heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme 
		example: the effect of air pollution control and life expectency 
	predictive 
		goal: use data on some objects to predict values for another object 
			if X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y 
		accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables 
		although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple model usually work really well
		prediction is very hard, especially about the future references 
		example: predict what's gonna happen in the next election cycle 
	causal
		goal: to find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change.
		usually randomized studies are required to identify causation
		there are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions 
		causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual
		causal models are usually the 'gold standard' for data analysis
		example: fecal infusion 
	mechanistic 
		goal: understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects 
		incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
		usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations
		generally the random component of the data is a measurement error
		if the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis
		
-------------------------
what is data?
	data - values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items 	
		set of items - sometimes called the population, the set of objects you are interested in 
		variables - measurements or characteristic of an object 
		qualitative - not necessarily ordered and not necessarily measured 
			country of origin, sex, treatment 
		quantitative - measured on continuous scale 
			height, weight, blood pressure
	
data is the second most important thing in data science 
	the most important thing is the question 
		
----------
experimental design
	poor analysis is a no 
	care about the analysis plan 

formulate question in advance
	
statistical inference 
	population > probability > sample > inferential statistics > population
